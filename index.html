        <div class="note">
            Please note that the information provided is based on a specific video guide and may not reflect the absolute latest updates in Hypixel Skyblock, as the game is constantly evolving.
        </div>

        <p>Hey Skyblockers! If you're an experienced player looking to start a new profile or just get back into the swing of things and reach the endgame quickly, this guide is for you. We'll be focusing on efficient progression and leveraging existing game knowledge rather than a full beginner experience.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>I. Early Game Setup & Essentials</h2>
        <p>Before we dive in, this guide assumes you're familiar with core Skyblock concepts like blueprints, skills, pets, and accessories. If you have an MVP+ account or account upgrades (like accessory bag and Ender Chest pages), you'll find gaining Skyblock XP even faster.</p>

        <h3>Your First Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rogue Sword Acquisition:</strong> Head straight to Jamie to grab your trusty Rogue Sword. This will be your early-game movement tool.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Coin Grab:</strong> Farm wheat and seeds until you accumulate around 13,000-14,000 coins.</li>
            <li><strong>Mining Merchant Buys:</strong> Purchase coal and gold from the mining merchant and immediately craft them into blocks.</li>
            <li><strong>First Pet - Common Bee:</strong> Buy a Common Bee Pet. This is a quick and easy source of early Skyblock XP.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlocking Carpentry:</strong> Head to the Wool Weaver and purchase 64 white wool. This will unlock the Carpentry skill.</li>
            <li><strong>Minion Prep:</strong> Buy a wooden shovel and a stack of wood from the lumber merchant. You'll need these for your early minions.</li>
            <li><strong>Shovel Enchantment:</strong> Enchant your newly acquired wooden shovel with Efficiency III.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Endgame Paths (Where to go next?):</h3>

            <li><strong>Mining:</strong> If you enjoy mining, rush Heart of the Mountain Level 7. With max gear, powder grinding can make you up to 70 million coins per hour!</li>

            <li><strong>Garden:</strong> The Garden is a viable long-term option. Focus on crop upgrades, completing garden milestones, and upgrading your composter for consistent farming profits.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Once you've established a consistent and profitable money-making method, Hypixel Skyblock truly becomes more enjoyable as you can easily acquire the resources needed to pursue any content you desire. Good luck on your Skyblock journey!</p>
