            <h2><span class="section-id">SECTION 01:</span> INITIAL ASSESSMENT</h2>

            <p>Subject exhibits profound disassociation, a consequence of an all-consuming obession that warped into something... unsustainable.
                The records indicate a progressive decline, marked by increasing self-destructive behaviors and a refusal of prescribed Clozapine.
                Subject is constantly in motion, a perpetual escape attempt from unseen pursuers, seeking refuge in the forgotten corners of the world.</p>

            <p>The line between reality and hallucination is dangerously thin. Observation is critical. The truth is often obscured by shadows and subjective perceptions.
                A burning internal fire appears to consume the subject, manifested by self-excoriation consistent with their alleged attempts to "cleanse" their skin.
                Current status: Uncontained.</p>

            <h2><span class="section-id">SECTION 03:</span> PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION (PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT)</h2>

            <p class="redacted-doc">Subject demonstrates severe self-injurious behavior,
                particularly cases consistent of obsessive manipulation of dermal layers. Subject refuses all pharmacotherapy,
                citing a desire to "remain awake" for their "visions." Constant reports of visual and auditory hallucinations,
                often involving anthropomorphic animals and distorted figures in peripheral vision. Paranoia regarding perceived pursuers ("the shadows," "the forest") is prevalent.
                Prognosis remains critically guarded. Intervention is proving ineffective as the patient consistently flees and finds new isolated locations.
                Last known location reported near an abandoned industrial complex. All attempts at detainment have failed.</p>

            <p class="redacted-doc-small">Subject exhibits strong negative emotions towards medical staff. Recommends re-evaluation of current treatment plan.
                Note: Patient carries small, worn photographs, fixated on one individual refered to as "them". References to "Divine Judgment" and "cleansing" are increasing.
                Further analysis of subject's connection to Project Chimera is pending approval.</p>
